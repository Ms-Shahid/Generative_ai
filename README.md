# Model Context Protocol (MCP)
---
This course provides a deep dive into Model Context Protocol (MCP), a new open standard transforming how LLM-powered agents interact with external systems. You’ll discover why MCP is a game changer for scalable, secure, and future-ready AI applications through a blend of theoretical insights and hands-on implementation. You’ll learn the motivation behind the agentic AI, unpack MCP’s architecture, and develop practical skills for building, deploying, and integrating your own MCP servers and clients—increasingly essential skills in the AI industry.


## What will you learn?
Throughout this course, you’ll begin by exploring the fundamental limitations of standalone LLMs, e.g., why even the . You’ll trace the industry’s journey from simple chatbots to fully agentic systems, discovering how introducing universal protocols like MCP has propelled the field to a tipping point.

This hands-on course begins with building your own MCP servers. You will define resources, tools, and prompts, and connect them to AI agents. You will work with real SDKs, experiment with integration patterns, and learn best practices for security, extensibility, and real-world deployments.

## Course structure

The journey begins with three lessons introducing the rationale for MCP: the limitations of LLMs, the transition to agentic systems, and the problem MCP was designed to solve. The subsequent four practical lessons focus on building MCP servers and clients and connecting agents to real-world tools, data, and platforms.

## From LLMs to agents

Retrieval Augumented-generation (RAG) helps with facts but doesn’t give the LLM memory across conversations or enable planning and automation.

RAG improved memory, but didn’t enable LLMs to act or plan.

Scripts/plug-ins could let LLMs “do” things, but every new tool or workflow meant new glue code and brittle integrations.

No approach lets LLMs make decisions, orchestrate multi-step tasks, or integrate seamlessly with a growing set of tools and resources.

## What makes a system agentic?
Agentic systems provide an LLM with a set of external tools and access to dynamic context, empowering the model to determine when and how to use those tools as it works to solve a task. In other words, the LLM is no longer just a passive generator of text; it is augmented with the capacity to:

Retrieve information (for example, searching the web or querying a database)

Invoke services or APIs (such as calling a weather service, sending an email, or running a calculation)

Maintain longer context or memory (by storing and recalling conversation history or relevant documents as needed)

Crucially, the agent decides which tool to use and when, based on the problem it’s trying to solve. This adaptability, the ability to choose and sequence actions appropriately, is central to agentic systems. Think back to our librarian: an agentic assistant is like one who, realizing a gap in their knowledge, says, “Let me check the latest report,” then uses a tool to fetch that report before answering.


## Limitations of agents
Giving an AI agent tools and context wasn’t a fix-all solution. Each new integration, whether connecting an LLM to a database, a cloud service, or a file system, still required custom code, careful prompt engineering, and special handling for security. For every new “ability,” you often had to build a new integration from scratch.

This approach doesn’t scale:

Developers found it difficult to scale truly connected systems when every data source needed a custom integration.

The proliferation of bespoke tools led to fragile systems, where one tool’s output might not be formatted as the LLM expects, causing errors or misinterpretations.

The field needed a universal, open, secure protocol to connect any tool, data source, or resource and allow agentic systems to truly scale.


> This is exactly why the Model Context Protocol (MCP) was created. MCP is the open standard designed to connect AI agents to the world of tools and data, securely, flexibly, and at scale.
